## How to play

Tubes is a remake of the popular phone game widely known as Pipes. Rotate a tube by clicking inside the square field it occupies. 
The objective is to connect all the tubes in a way that doesn't leave open ends (when you do so it notifies you).
The default playing field is 8x8, but if you wish to customize it you can change the numbers in the text boxes and click the "New game" button.

## Structure

* Tubes.js is the main file with the code that runs the game.
* General.js contains the functions that draw basic shapes on canvas.
* Click.js contains the functions that process mouse clicks.
* Game.js is just a general function that resets a 2-dimensional array.
